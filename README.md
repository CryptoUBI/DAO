# Fund KYC for Crypto UBI Anti Sybil and/or Fund Efforts to Hasten Defeat of Aging

This is about funding anti-sybil methods for cryptocurrency basic incomes. 

Hedge for Humanity (H4H) is an organization that is attempting to implement the basic income cryptocurrency Manna. 

H4H and Manna started as Grantcoin and has evolved into what it is today. 

Manna cryptocurrency has had sybil issues when distributing Manna. 

Bright ID is a project that may help to stop sybil problems for basic income cryptocurrencies. 

The goal is here is to fund $400,000 in cryptocurrency. 

This funding is not sanctioned by H4H. 

Therefore, if this $400,000 goal is accrued, H4H has the option to decline or refuse funding. 

If this $400K goal is achieved and H4H refuses this funding then the following will happen:

The funds will be donated to SENS Research Foundation (SENSRF), a nonprofit attempting to hasten the defeat of aging. Vitalik Buterin has supported this organization some. 

If the $400K funding goal is achieved and H4H and SENSRF refuses this funding, then the money will be donated to Life Extension Advocacy Foundation (LEAF). 

If LEAF, H4H, and SENSRF all refuse this funding, then the money will be returned back to bounty contributors or donated to Heifer International, depending on which option is easiest and simplest.
