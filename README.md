# Crypto UBI DAO

# Monero as a way of implementing a form of basic income (August 2023) 

Biometic and various crypto UBI projects have problems. The cryptocurrency Monero could potentially be a way to mitigate some or all of these problems.

# Fund KYC for Crypto UBI Anti Sybil and/or Fund Efforts to Hasten Defeat of Aging (Created in August 2020)

This is about funding anti-sybil methods for cryptocurrency basic incomes. 

Hedge for Humanity (H4H) is an organization that is attempting to implement the basic income cryptocurrency Manna. H4H and Manna started as Grantcoin and has evolved into what it is today. Manna cryptocurrency has had sybil issues when distributing Manna. 

Bright ID is a project that may help to stop sybil problems for basic income cryptocurrencies. It is unclear when Bright ID will be ready for mass adoption to prevent sybil issues for cryptocurrencies and dentralized autonmous organizations. Bright ID could function enough to deter sybils in 1 year? 10 years? Unknown? Maybe the timeline is more definite than it seems. When implemented successfully, Bright ID may be a decentralized method of stopping sybil problems. Know Your Customer (KTC) is a corporate centralized method of preventing sybil problems. 

The goal is here is to fund $400,000 in cryptocurrency. 

Jumio is one more well established KYC provider. About 1.5 to 2 years ago, a representative at Jumio stated something along the lines of for between 12,000 to 50,000+ KYC checks per year about at least, each KYC check might cost 1 to 2 fiat US dollars about. 

While this may have changed, Jumio seems to be the most comprehensive KYC provider servicing the most countries and citizens. There might be better KYC (corporate sybil preventers) out there than Jumio, if researched. 

If H4H decided to use traditional corporate KYC until decentralized anti sybil could be implemented, many might happily pay from between 5 to 30 dollars for a lifetime h4h membership to recieve crypto ubi. Such payments could fund KYC needs and also create a fund to provide free or subsized KYC for individuals on Earch earning less than $3 USD per day. 

This funding project is not sanctioned by H4H. Therefore, if this $400,000 goal is accrued, H4H has the option to decline or refuse funding. 

If this $400K goal is achieved and H4H refuses this funding then the following will happen:

The funds will be donated to SENS Research Foundation (SENSRF), a nonprofit attempting to hasten the defeat of aging. Vitalik Buterin has supported this organization some. 

If the $400K funding goal is achieved and H4H and SENSRF refuses this funding, then the money will be donated to Life Extension Advocacy Foundation (LEAF). 

If LEAF, H4H, and SENSRF all refuse this funding, then the money will be returned back to bounty contributors or donated to Heifer International, depending on which option is easiest and simplest.
